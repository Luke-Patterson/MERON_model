Input: Child image x from the dataset and Residual Block, lower vanishing gradient using ResNet as H(x)
Output: Prediction of Malnutrition kids by image segmentation of hair color Chin structure -> optimal solution.
1
Begin
For each X input do
Convo Layer = Face image (); // 3X3 image split into different layer
2
3
Build a Residual Block (ResNet-50)
4
For each Normalization process do
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
Padding 3x3 matrix image
image data for each residual block is to be loaded, kids Face image Embedded normalize
H(x)=F(x)+W(x)×X; // Store Face image's weight skip connection
Relu→F(x)+X; // initial activation from stride 1
Yk= H(Xk)+F(Xk,Wk );
Else
for kernel size as 1 then reshaping of Face image as 64 convoy layers as 256 residue blocks do
imagek = Xn Yn;
Split the data to Train and Test based on 40:10 (Train set, Test set);
Reshaping Face images embed to the output of 64-Softmax; move Next Residual layer;
Update the Reshape of the Face image to all residual blocks;
Evaluate the final block outcome move to Resnet;
End For:
Move the next layer as 1000 class Face image input;
H(X) = Softmax(W1):// weight change stride change transfer to final layer else
Apply Activation=Sigmoid (H(x))
1 1+e-n'
// Reduce overfitting
Utilize (kernel as 7*7 and output as 2048) in this step;
Up sampling done;
for Prediction do
Estimate L2 Regularization;
Estimate Loss Function to obtain Performance of ResNet 50;//Obtained the final result
